## Abstract 
Capability-based addressing in the CHERI architecture is designed to improve hardware-level system security. These security guarantees can degrade runtime performance due to increased L1 TLB misses. Our aim is to achieve capability based security at reduced performance cost. We will use fat pointers to simplify and implement a recently proposed range TLB scheme, with the goal of reducing L1 TLB misses and page-walks for memory-intensive CHERI workloads.
